HOW TO PLAY "CARD-INGO"

    • Open the terminal and type 'python main.py'
        -> This will run the 'main.py' file
    • The program will then ask to input the number corresponding to the game the user wants to play, or 0 to exit
        -> 0 to exit the game
        -> 1 for Trump (4-player game)
        -> 2 for Black Jack (n-player game)
        -> 3 for War (2-player game)
        -> 4 for High or Low (1-player game)
    • For each game played, the user will be first asked if they want to see the rules or not
        -> This will trigger the 'rules.py' file which contains the rules for all the games
    • The users can then continue playing the game
    • The game uses the built in function 'sleep' from the package 'time'
        -> To pause after every input or turn so the player can follow the speed of python without getting confused and enjoy playing
    • After playing a game, the user is asked if they want to play another game or not
        -> 'Yes/No', if 'No', the control goes back to the main function, and runs the 'last' function which prints a Thank You message and the Project information

The name 'CARD-INGO' is inspired from the game 'BINGO' !
